How I did Module 1 Challenge

-I downloaded the starter code from the github repository given to the class.
-I copied the starter code in VS Code, including the CSS file and the HTML file.
-I then went on to link my VS Code with my Github so that I could commit changes through VS Code
-After I got everything set up I began to look at the HTML and CSS files and started planning on how I was going to go about doing the Challenge.
-After going over the criteria, I then started to insert the pictures that were given to the class.
-At first I couldn't get the picture for .hero in css to align correctly, but that was a quick fix by going back to the starter code. I had to go back because I didn't realize the starter code had already been set up to just copy and paste the link of the image.
-I went on to add all the other pictures into the code.
-Next I looked for the error in the code that wouldn't allow you to click on "Search Engine Optimization" and take you straight to that segment. I found the section of code that was missing and added it so that it would work.
I then changed some of the <div>'s into <header>, <footer>, and <sections>'s to help better organize the code. This helped differentiate the larger sections of the web-page, and also helping differentiate the header and footer.
Adding all of the given pictures was simple, although I couldn't get a link for any of them to stay in the code as a permanant link, so they all started disappearing after a days time.
To fix this problem I went into my OneDrive and got permalinks for ach photo and entered those into the code.
After, I read through my changes and made sure everything looked up to par, before going on to make this ReadMe.md file.
After making the ReadmeChal1.md file, I commited it in VS Code to my repository, checking off everything on my list as far as known criteria and steps.
